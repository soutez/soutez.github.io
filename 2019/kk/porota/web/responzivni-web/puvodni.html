                <div class="preview">
                    Hi everyone, I was wondering if there was a website that had designs of websites that one can try to implement with HTML & CSS? I am just looking for a way to practice what I am learning. On top of this, maybe even add a little bit of interactivity with Javascript and jQuery. At work I use React right now and get the job done, but just want to further my front end development skills through challenges like these. Thanks! Let me know if you happen to know of any.
